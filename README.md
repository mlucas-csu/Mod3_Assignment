# Mod3_Assignment

Code includes 2 different parts that achieve different goals

In the first part, the user inputs the cost of their meal at a restaurant
They then calculate the amount of money they should tip based on an 18% rate
They also calculate the cost of the sales tax to add to their bill
The program then outputs the total cost for the user including the meal, the tip, and the sales tax

In the second part, the user inputs what time it is on a 24-hr clock (e.g. 6 pm is 18)
Then they set an alarm and input into the program in how many hours that alarm is going to go off
I then use the modulo operator based on the 24-hr clock to determine at what time on the 24 hour clock that the alarm will go off
